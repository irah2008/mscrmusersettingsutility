# MSCRM User Settings Utility
HTML based Dynamics CRM user settings utility which will help to Administrator to set the User settings for Dynamics CRM Users. 

This tool was inspired by User settings Utility in Xrm Toolbox, when we hit a limitation that EXE cannot be run in the client environment and there was a 2FA authentication required. This caused me to develop this built in Dynamics CRM component which can be run from CRM to control the user settings.
